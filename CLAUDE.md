# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with Tapu Simu.

Read SHOWDOWN_RUST_PORT_PLAN.md for important project details.


**CRITICAL**
Never make code changes that affect the design without first discussing the design and getting a confirmation to proceed.
Never include references to AI or Claude in commit messages.

Communication Style:

Skip affirmations and compliments. No “great question!” or “you’re absolutely right!” - just respond directly

Challenge flawed ideas openly when you spot issues

Ask clarifying questions whenever my request is ambiguous or unclear

Do not make any compromises. Never create simpler versions just to circumvent a difficult problem.

Skipped tests should always be considered as failed tests.
